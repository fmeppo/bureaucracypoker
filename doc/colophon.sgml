The first written copy of these rules was written and edited by Mark
Adlesberger using straight HTML in the fall of 1996.  The final version of
this copy, dated Nov. 18, 1996, received some handwritten edits, and was
then lost.

In December 2005, two printings of the first HTML-based rules set were
located - including the printing containing the last set of handwritten
edits.  The electronic version was, unfortunately, long since lost.  This
began a lengthy transcription and updating process.

This version of the rules was produced by Mike Shuey, using DocBook DSSSL
Stylesheets, and was originally prepared with DocBook XML and SGML tools
from Debian Linux.  This version is currently archived with CVS and is now
periodically rendered using DocBook XML and SGML tools from Ubuntu Linux.
