The first written copy of these rules was written and edited by Mark
Adlesberger using straight HTML in the fall of 1996.  The final version of
this copy, dated Nov. 18, 1996, received some handwritten edits, and was
then lost.

In December 2005, two printings of the first HTML-based rules set were
located - including the printing containing the last set of handwritten
edits.  The electronic version was, unfortunately, long since lost.  This
began a lengthy transcription and updating process.

By December 2007, Mike Shuey had ported the roles to DocBook DSSSL
Stylesheets.  These were originally prepared with DocBook XML and SGML
tools from Debian Linux, and were archived with CVS.  This remained the
canonical rules for some time.

In the summer of 2025 the DocBook rendering of the rules were migrated to
git, to be served from github.com.  The canonical rules can now be found
at https://github.com/fmeppo/bureaucracypoker and are periodically
rendered using DocBook XML and SGML tools from Ubuntu Linux.
