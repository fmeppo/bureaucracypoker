    <para>
    Okay, for relatively quick reference, here are many of the terms of the game
    defined in alphabetical order.  Player B is seated next to Player A in the
    direction of play.
    </para>

<glossdiv><title>B</title>
    <glossentry id="beginning-of-a-turn">
    <glossterm>Beginning of a Turn</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	The beginning of a turn is the time at which the player is able to
	decide whether to keep or to scrap his hand.  The beginning of Player
	B's turn comes after Player A ends his turn and all players finish
	resolving all effects from 5s, 6s, and cards-to-be-played (unless
	Player A regains the turn or Player B is skipped).

    <glossentry id="breaking-a-tile">
    <glossterm>Breaking a Tile</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	In certain cases, a tile must be broken.  This means that the cards are
	no longer displayed as a tile.  Each counts as an individual card.
	When the tile is broken, immediate effects of the cards that were in
	the tile are ignored.  Continuous effects of these cards take effect
	at this time, though (unless, of course, the cards become no-effect).
	</para>

<glossdiv><title>C</title>
    <glossentry id="cards-in-play">
    <glossterm>Cards in Play</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	The cards a player has played or had played onto his table.  Continuous
	effects of these cards are considered at all times unless the cards
	are no-effect.
	</para>
	<glossseealso otherterm="no-effect-cards"/>
    </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry id="cards-to-be-played">
    <glossterm>Cards-to-be-Played</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	Certain cards result in a player having cards-to-be-played.  They must
	be resolved immediately, in whatever order the player chooses.  The card
	played on a 6 must come from the viewing hand, not cards-to-be-played.
	The card played on a 5 may come from either the viewing hand or the
	cards-to-be-played.  If two players have cards-to-be-played, the one
	who got his cards-to-be-played most recently plays his first.  Having
	cards-to-be-played does not mean it is your turn.
	</para>
    </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry id="continuous-effect">
    <glossterm>Continuous Effect</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	A special rule effect that is constantly being considered as long as the
	card causing it is in play and is not a no-effect card.  The effects of
	a 4 are continuous effects, for example.
	</para>
	<glossseealso otherterm="no-effect-cards"/>
    </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry id="contracts">
    <glossterm>Contracts</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	A player can make a contract to buy and sell cards in play, but this
	should be kept to a minimum since it is almost always a form of teaming.
	Cards exchanged in this way are not played onto the recipient's table.
	Immediate effects of the card are ignored, although unless the card
	is no-effect its continuous effects do take effect.
	</para>

    <glossentry id="control">
    <glossterm>Control</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	A control situation occurs when you use a 6 to force a 10&diamonds; on
	another player.  See section 2.11 for details.
	</para>
    </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry id="correct-number-of-cards-in-viewing-hand">
    <glossterm>Correct Number of Cards in Viewing Hand</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	The number of cards that you must maintain in your viewing hand.  If
	you have too many, discard.  If you have too few, draw from your stash.
	Unless it has been changed by Part II rules, the correct number is 7.
	</para>

<glossdiv><title>D</title>
    <glossentry id="deck">
    <glossterm>Deck</glossterm>

	<para>
	The deck consists of 52-card poker decks plus Jokers.  Remove all but
	two (2) of the 10&clubs; and all but one (1) of the 9&diamonds;.  Use
	at least two (2) poker decks per player.

<glossdiv><title>E</title>
    <glossentry id="empire">
    <glossterm>Empire</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	Sometimes, the number of cards on a table gets really, really, big.
	When the number of cards on a single player's table is at least twelve
	(12), that player is said to have an Empire.  Other terms may be
	defined for tables that get exceptionally, ridiculously large.  The
	record size for an Empire so far was achieved by Mike Shuey when he
	played 177 cards in one turn.

<glossdiv><title>F</title>
    <glossentry id="fee">
    <glossterm>Fee</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	Any payment of cards may be designated as a fee by the effect that
	demands the payment, making it subject to cards that modify fees.  No
	fee may ever be negative.  Players who have resigned from, or lost, the
	current hand are not subject to fees.
	</para>
    </glossdef>
    </glossentry>

    <glossentry id="fine">
    <glossterm>Fine</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	If you do something that the group votes is a misdoing (in other words,
	you do something wrong like breaking a rule or being obnoxious) you
	must pay a fine.  Fines are not effected by Js or 8s.  They may not be
	negative.  Anyone who is in the game is subject to fines.

    <glossentry id="five-card-poker-hand">
    <glossterm>Five-card Poker Hand</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
	<para>
	The cards a player has declared as his five-card poker hand should be
	displayed on his table in a manner that makes it clear that it is his
	five card poker hand.  It may contain up to five (5) cards.  If, at the
	beginning of his turn, a player has the highest five-card poker hand,
	he wins the hand.  The five-card poker hand is part of the player's
	cards in play.

    <glossdef>
	<para>
	A game begins when the splitter splits the cards and ends when no more
	than two players remain, at which time the player with the most cards
	wins.  In the highly unlikely event that the remaining players have
	the same number of cards, the game is a tie.

	the number of cards that the player playing them will play.  This
	requires that the player who's cards-to-be-played are to be halted
	has just completed a card effect and has at least 7 cards-to-be-played.
	The player with the highest 5-card poker hand (not counting the hand
	of the player whose cards-to-be-played are being played) may halt the
	cards-to-be-played by putting his five-card poker hand into the pot.
	Any of the cards-to-be-played in question that would put more cards into
	cards-to-be-played or allow the person playing them to play more
	cards are then put onto said player's table with none of their
	immediate effects occurring.
