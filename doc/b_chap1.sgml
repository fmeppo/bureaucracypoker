<title>History</title>
    <para>
    Bureaucracy Poker was invented and developed in 1994 by Mark "Durak"
    Adelsberger, John "Death" Adelsberger, John "Jelly Roll" Bley, and Mike
    "The Idiot" Shuey, all from St. Louis, MO.  If you are lucky, you can get
    more information, including up-to-date rules information, by e-mailing
    <email>&contact_email;</email> (&contact_name;).  If you are not lucky, then
    when you attempt to do so you will be told that no up-to-date information
    exists yet.  Rules often become obsolete within a matter of a few days,
    and in one case (the record to date) a set of rules expired within three
    hours of being written.
    </para>

    <para>
    NOTE - because the NBPI members now go to college in three different states,
    rules changes are less frequent during the school year than they are
    during the Summer.

    <primary>Splitter</primary>
    <secondary>Definition</secondary>
</indexterm>
    One player, called the splitter, takes the well-shuffled &bp; deck and
    divides it into a number of roughly equal-sized stacks equal to the
    number of players.  Each player in turn, starting on the splitter's left
    and continuing around the table to the left, takes on of the stacks.  The
    stack that a player takes is then that player's stash.  This method
    ("splitting") is used instead of dealing because dealing a deck of
    several hundred cards would take too long, and you wouldn't have enough
    time to play the game.
    </para>

    <para>
    The flat playing space is divided as follows: In front of each player is
    that player's "table."  In the center (between the tables) is a space for
    a discard pile and a pot.  Each player's table has space set aside for
    that player's five-card poker hand.  All the cards on a player's table
    are his cards in play.  Between a player and his table is space for his
    cards-to-be-played.
    </para>

    <para>
    Each player draws seven cards from his stash.  These are the player's
    viewing hand.  These cards may not be shown to other players; treat them
    as you would treat your hand in a game of five-card draw.  You must at
    all times have the correct number of cards in your viewing hand.  If you
    have too few, draw from your stash until you have the correct number
    (unless, of course, your stash has no cards left).  If you have too many,
    put cards of your choice from your viewing hand onto the discard pile
    until you have the correct number.  You may NOT voluntarily discard when
    you don't have to.  The correct number of cards for your viewing hand is
    seven, unless special card rules change it.
    </para>

    <para>
<indexterm type="bpoker">
    <primary>Splitter</primary>
    <secondary>First play</secondary>
</indexterm>
    The splitter has the first play.  He puts a card from his viewing hand
    onto his table.  This is called playing a card.  The special card rule
    for this card is invoked.  Remember to draw from your stash after
    playing a card in order to keep the correct number of cards in your
    viewing hand.  The splitter continues playing cards from his hand onto
    his table, invoking each special card rule as he does so, until either
    he can no longer legally do so or he has the maximum number of cards on
    his table.  At this time, his turn is over.  Unless it has been altered
    by special card rules, the maximum number of cards on a player's table
    is five (5).  Play then passes to the next player in the direction of
    play.  Unless it has been altered by special card rules, the direction
    of play is to the left.  Transfer of turn from one player to the next is
    a little tricky.  Here's how it works:
    </para>

    <para>
    A player, whom we shall call Player A, is nearing the end of his turn.
    Player B is sitting next to Player A such that he is next in the direction
    of play.  Player A has 1 less card on the table than his maximum number
    of cards on the table.  He plays a card.  His turn is over and it is
    Player B's turn.  <emphasis>However</emphasis>, if Player A just played
    a 6, 5, or a card which causes him to have cards-to-be-played, he must
    resolve these things <emphasis>immediately</emphasis>, before Player B
    can actually take any actions.  The point in Player B's turn known as
    the "beginning" of his turn does not occur until such effects are resolved,
    but it <emphasis>is</emphasis> Player B's turn.  If, for some reason,
    Player B's turn is ended before it can begin, none of the effects that
    normally occur at the beginning of a turn occur.
    </para>

    <para>
    At the beginning of a player's turn, the following things occur:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	Any Chapter Two effects that are triggered by the beginning of a turn
	occur.  The player who's turn is beginning may choose the order in which
	these effects occur.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	A check is made to see if the player wins the hand.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	The player chooses whether to keep or scrap his hand (see below).
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	If the player has any sideways cards in his stash, he turns the topmost
	one of them back to the normal (non-sideways) position and his turn
	ends.
	</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
    If Player A's turn is over but the beginning of Player B's turn has not
    been reached, then Player A can "regain" the turn by reducing his number
    of cards on the table to less than the maximum number of cards on his
    table.  His turn does not begin again; he doesn't get to choose whether
    to scrap his hand again, nor does a check to see if he wins occur.  He
    does get to continue playing cards until something ends his turn again
    (such as having the maximum number of cards on his table again).  When
    his turn does end again, it is treated just like the end of any turn, and
    it is Player B's turn.  <emphasis>Pay close attention to this fact: if
    Player A skips Player B and then regains the turn, then Player A has
    wasted an attempt to skip Player B, because when Player A ends his turn
    again, Player B's turn follows.</emphasis>
    </para>

    <para>
    If, at the beginning of his turn, a player has cards on his table, he has
    the following options:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	He may "scrap" his hand.  To "scrap" one's hand means to put all cards
	from one's table into the pot.  His turn continues as normal.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	He may keep his hand.  If he has a number of cards on his table equal to
	or greater than the maximum number of cards on the table, then his turn
	is over.  If not, then he may continue playing as normal, building his
	hand on the cards he has kept.
	</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
</section>

<section id="handdeclaration">
<title>Hand Declaration</title>
    <para>
    Players may get more than five (5) cards on their tables.  When this
    happens, it is important to declare what your five-card poker hand is.  A
    player may change his five-card poker hand at the end of his turn or when,
    during another player's turn, cards are added to or removed from his
    table.  These five cards should be placed in such a way that other players
    can tell that they are the player's five-card poker hand.
    <emphasis>Only the declared five-card poker hand counts in determining the
    winner of the game.</emphasis>
    If at any time failure to declare makes a player's five-card poker hand
    ambiguous (i.e., a card from his hand was destroyed and he fails to make
    his new declaration clear), then that player's hand is ranked as crap.
    </para>
</section>

<section id="winning">
<title>Winning</title>
    <para>
    A player wins the current hand if, at the beginning of his turn, he has
    the highest five-card poker hand of all players.  He takes the pot and
    adds it to his stash.  The discard pile becomes the pot and a new hand is
    begun.  If, by some strange occurrence, all players lose the hand before
    anyone wins (i.e., all are removed from the hand by 10&clubs;s), then the
    discard
    pile is added to the pot.  Nobody takes the pot, the hand is a tie, and a
    new hand is begun, with the player with the smallest stash playing first.
    This is really very unlikely.
    </para>

    <para>
    If, at the end of any hand, only two players remain in the game, then the
    one with the larger stash wins the game.
    </para>

    Straights cannot wrap from A to 1 (e.g., Q-K-A-1-2 is not a straight -
    though a Joker will count as a 1).
    </para>
    
    <para>
    A monochromatic (all cards of the
    same color) hand beats any non-monochromatic hand.  The regular hand
    progression applies within monochromatic hands (e.g., a monochromatic
    pair beats a monochromatic high card).
    </para>

    <para>
    A flush hand (all cards of the same suit) beats any non-flush hand.  The
    regular hand progression applies within flush hands.  Note that any flush
    hand is also monochromatic.
    </para>

    <para>
    If two hands are exactly the same, they tie.  If there is a tie for the
    highest hand on the table, then neither player has the highest hand, so
    neither would win when his turn begins.  For example, A and B both have
    5-of-a-kind A (Aces) flush with two wilds.  A's turn begins.  He doesn't
    have the single highest hand on the table, so he doesn't yet win the hand.
    </para>

    <para>
    A player's initial hand (before his first turn) is Nothing.
    </para>
</section>

<section id="resigning">
<title>Resigning</title>
    <para>
    A player may resign from the hand at any time.  He no longer pays fees for
    card effects during that hand.  If he resigns after a card that requires
    some type of fee is played (a 7 or a 5, for example) but before he pays
    for it, he doesn't have to pay for it.  He puts all of the cards on his
    table into the pot and his viewing hand into his stash.  He may resume
    playing in the next hand.  As long as he is in the game, he is still
    subject to fines for any misdoings.
    </para>

    <para>
    If a player resigns from the game, he puts his viewing hand in his stash
    and his table in the pot.  He then adds his stash to the discard.
    </para>
</section>

<section id="losing">
<title>Losing the Game</title>
    <para>
    If you have no cards in your stash and are forced to pay a fee or fine,
    you must "cannibalize" your other cards.  First, you must pay from your
    viewing hand.  If you run out of cards in your viewing hand, you must
    pay from your table.  If you run out of cards on your table, you must
    pay from your cards-to-be-played.  In all cases, you choose which cards
    you use to pay the fee or fine.
    </para>

    <para>
    If you completely run out of cards and still must pay a fee or fine, you
    have lost.  If you are completely out of cards at the end of any hand,
    you have lost.
    </para>
</section>

<section id="cardstobeplayed">
<title>Cards-to-be-Played</title>
    <para>
    In some situations, cards will be put in your cards-to-be-played.  These
    cards <emphasis>must be played immediately</emphasis> even if it is
    another player's turn.  If multiple sets of cards to be played exist,
    then the sets are resolved in LIFO order (last in, first out; the last set
    created is the first set resolved).  This has no effect on whose turn it
    is.
    </para>

    <para>
    When you gain cards-to-be-played, one of two things happens: either you
    create a new set of cards-to-be-played or you add them to your most
    recent set of cards-to-be-played.  If you already have at least one set
    of cards-to-be-played, and if the most recent of your sets of
    cards-to-be-played is the most recent set that any player has, then you
    add the new cards to that set.  Otherwise, you create a new set.
    </para>

    <para>
    You may play your cards-to-be-played from your most recent set in any
    order.  They may not be played as card pairs.  If you play a 6, then the
    card that you use to shaft another player must be from your viewing hand,
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> your cards-to-be-played.  You may, however,
    use cards-to-be-played from your most recent set or cards from your
    viewing hand in a 5-tile (see Chapter 2 rules on the 5).  Except to
    resolve a 6 or a 5, you may not use cards from your viewing hand until
    you have used all your cards-to-be-played.
    </para>

    <para>
    At any time when a player is playing cards-to-be-played, has at least
    7 cards-to-be-played, and has just finished resolving a card effect, the
    player (not counting the player playing cards-to-be-played) with the
    highest 5-card poker hand may "halt" the cards-to-be-played.  If the
    highest 5-card poker hand (not counting the player playing
    cards-to-be-played) is a tie, then any player involved in the tie may
    halt the cards-to-be-played.
    </para>

    <para>
    If a player halts the cards-to-be-played, then he must first put his
    5-card poker hand into the pot.  Then, all cards in the current set of
    cards-to-be-played (the set that is currently being played) that allow
    the player playing them to play more cards or to put more cards into
    his cards-to-be-played are put directly onto that player's table without
    any of their immediate effects occurring.
    </para>

    <para>
    No player with crap may ever halt cards-to-be-played.
    </para>

    <para>
    A player may never halt cards-to-be-played that he is playing.
    </para>
</section>

<section id="directionofplay">
<title>Direction of Play</title>
    <para>
    The direction of play, at the beginning of the game, is left.  This may be
    changed as the game progresses.  Using one of the spare 10&clubs; and
    9&diamonds; from the deck (the cards you removed from the 52-card poker
    decks, see section 1.2), the direction of play should be marked.  Place
    the two cards on the table between the discard and the pot.
    <emphasis>Be careful</emphasis> not to mistake these cards for the
    discard or the pot.  When the direction of play is left, the 9&diamonds;
    should be showing; when the direction of play is right, the 10&clubs;
    should be showing.  In this way, it is possible to keep track of the
    direction of play at all times.
    </para>
</section>

    The following guidelines have been developed to keep the game fun.  The
    names Player A, Player B, Player C, etc. refer to distinct players (in
    no particular seating order).
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	No teams.  Don't gang up on one player.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	Unless Player A has a reason to be mad at Player B (e.g., Player B
	caused Player C to win the last hand), Player A should not repeatedly
	use his cards' powers to harm Player B.  There is no need to start
	a war, as it tends to cause the game to degenerate and the player(s)
	who aren't taking sides tend to get an advantage.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	Viewing hands are secret.  You may neither request nor give
	information about viewing hands.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	No player may look through the pot, the discard, or any player's
	stash (all terms explained later).  <emphasis>However</emphasis>, if
	a card is placed in the wrong pile, it must be moved to the correct
	one unless the group has agreed to fine the offending player instead.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	In situations that require a vote, each player gets one and only one
	vote.  This applies even to players who have folded from the hand or
	the game.  A vote is required in any situation that the &corbp; cannot
	resolve.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	If a situation is impossible to resolve the vote comes to a tie, then
	the game game is restarted; all players give all cards to the
	splitter who re-splits.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	No money can be in any way involved in the game except for the
	purchase of supplies needed for the game (such as cards, snacks, etc.).
	In fact, it is advised that no form of wager at all should be made.
	Not only does betting make the game less fun, but it is foolish;
	nobody can predict the results of a &bp; game, regardless of what cards
	are in that person's hand.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	All cards on any player's table are public information.  All players
	have the right to know what cards are on each player's table.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	The group can vote to apply fines to players for any misdoings.  No
	BS about freedom of speech if the group fines you for saying something
	disgusting; it's just a game, not a federal action.  Fines can
	<emphasis>not</emphasis> be retroactive.  If a player does something
	that is obnoxious then that players can vote to fine him
	<emphasis>if he does it again</emphasis> but he cannot be fined for
	<emphasis>having done it</emphasis> unless it had already been
	declared grounds for a fine.  The players may vote to have the fine
	paid to the pot, all players, the player(s) affected, or whatever.
