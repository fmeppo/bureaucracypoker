    Immediate Effects: Any effect that doesn't specify that it is one of the
    other types of effects is an immediate effect.  Such an effect is resolved
    as soon as the card that causes it is played.  If the effect cannot be
    resolved immediately it is lost completely; it cannot be called upon
    later.
