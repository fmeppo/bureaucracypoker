It is not recommended that you learn the game by reading these rules.  The
&nbpi; is developing and testing methods of training new players.  This is
mainly
meant as a reference manual.  It is, however, possible to learn the game from
these rules.  If you intend to do so, read them carefully at least two times to
make sure you understand them, refer to them often as you start to play, and
<emphasis>for God's sake, don't try to start with the individual card effect
rules in place!!!  Start without them and add them gradually as you learn the
game!!!</emphasis>
