    Fractal Poker was added to Bureaucracy Poker in 1994 by Mark "Durak"
    Adelsberger, John "Death" Adelsberger, John "Jelly Roll" Bley, and Mike
    "The Idiot" Shuey, all from St. Louis, MO.  For further rules
    information, follow the procedure outlined in section 1.1 of the

<title>Game Play</title>
    <para>
    Fractal Poker is normally started as a result of special rules in
    Bureaucracy Poker.  No official rules exist for starting a stand-alone
    game of Fractal Poker.
    </para>

    <para>
    At the start of the Fractal Poker game, each player should have a stash
    and a card pile should be established as the f_pot.
    </para>

    <para>
    Each player draws five (5) cards from his stash.  This is the player's
    f_hand.  The first round of betting begins.  The total bet starts at zero
    (0).  Each player, in turn, starting with the first player and proceeding
    in the direction of play, has three options:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	He may match the total bid by turning up a number of cards equal to the
	total bid into the f_pot.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	He may raise the total bid.  The maximum amount by which he may raise
	the total bid, unless it has been modified by Part II rules, is three
	(3).  He must then turn up a number of cards equal to the new total
	bid into the f_pot.
	</para></listitem>

	<listitem><para>
	He may resign (see section 1.6).
	</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
    After the first round of betting comes the draw round.  Each player, in
    turn, declares how many cards he wishes to draw.  He may choose any number
    from zero (0) to three (3), unless those values have been changed by Part
    II rules.  He places that number of cards from his hand into the f_pot.
    These cards' special card rules are not invoked.  Then he draws that number
    of cards from his stash.
    </para>

    <para>
    After the draw round comes a second round of betting, exactly like the
    first.  After the second round of betting, the player with the highest
    ranking f_hand (see section 1.5) wins.  The f_pot is added to his stash.
    </para>

<section id="f-handranking">
<title>Hand Ranking</title>
    <para>
    The hands rank, from low to high, as follows:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	Crap - any player may declare his hand as crap if he wants to
	</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
    Jokers are wild; they may have any suit, color, and rank at any time.
    Straights can not wrap from A to 1 (e.g., Q-K-A-1-2 is not a straight).  A
    monochromatic (all cards of the same color) beats any non-monochromatic
    hand.  The regular hand progression applies within monochromatic (i.e., a
    monochromatic pair beats a monochromatic high card).
    </para>

    <para>
    A flush (all cards of the same suit) beats any non-flush hand.  The regular
    hand progression applies within flush.  (Note that any flush is also
    monochromatic.)
    </para>

    <para>
    If two hands are exactly the same except that one has fewer wilds than the
    other, then the one with fewer wilds is higher.
    </para>

    <para>
    If two or more hands are exactly identical, then they tie.  The players
    who have the tied hands play another hand of f_poker to determine the
    winner, using the same f_pot as was used for this hand.
    </para>

<section id="f-resigning">
<title>Resigning</title>
    <para>
    A player may resign at any time.  He places his f_hand into his stash.  He
    no longer bets, has the chance to win, or is subject to Part II rules.  If
    a Part II rule was just invoked, he is still subject to it if it is still
    applicable.  If at any time a player does not have enough cards in his
    stash to match the total bet when it is his turn to bet, he must resign.
    If at any time a Part II rule requires that a player do something with
    cards from his stash, and he doesn't have enough cards in his stash to do
    so, he must resign and that Part II effect does not occur.
