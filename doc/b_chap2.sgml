    Please, <emphasis>please, we implore you</emphasis>, read these rules a
    number of times.  They won't make sense until you do, because the rules
    for many of the cards refer to the rules for other cards.

    To pay another player is to give him cards from your stash face down,
    which he then adds to his stash.  Unless otherwise specified, this paying
    another player is a fee.  Any fee other than paying another player will
    specify that it is a fee.
    </para>

    To pay cards to the pot is to put cards from your stash into the pot.  To
    pay cards to the discard is to put cards from your stash into the discard.

<title>Special Card Types</title>
    <section id="wilds">
    <title>Wilds</title>
	<para>
	A "wild" is a card that may at any time be given any value (suit and
	rank) for purposes of calculating 5-card poker hands.  The player on
	who's table the card is may declare it to have any suit and any rank
	whenever he declares his 5-card poker hand.  The declared suit and
	rank affect only the card's value in the 5-card poker hand, not any
	effects the card might have; a wild has no special effects.
	</para>

	<para>
	The fact that a card is wild is marked by its being placed face-down
	on the player's table.  Such a card is said to "have become" wild and
	loses all of its original characteristics.  If a wild is "replayed,"
	it first regains its old properties; turn it face-up and treat the
	situation as though that card had just been played.
	</para>

	<para>
	Wilds are protected cards (see below).
	</para>
    </section>

    <section id="tiles">
    <title>Tiles</title>
	<para>
	A "tile" is a set of two or more cards played in such a way as to
	remain related while on the player's table.  (The most common
	example is a 5-tile; whenever cards are to be tiled, the effect that
	causes them to be tiled will give specific information about the
	tile's effect.)  While cards are tiled, their individual effects are
	not considered (e.g., a 4&clubs; in a tile doesn't subtract one from
	the number of cards you may hold in your viewing hand).  A tile is
	considered one protected card (see Protected Cards below) for
	purposes of interaction with most other cards.  Replaying a tile
	causes the effect of the tile, not the individual cards that make it
	up, to be replayed.  Each card in a tile is counted separately
	towards the maximum number of cards you may have on your table, and
	each may independently be added or removed from your declared 5-card
	poker hand.  If you are forced to cannibalize from your table, you
	may use each card from the tile separately.  If for this, or any
	other reason, part of the tile leaves your table, the remainder of
	the tile is "broken up."
	</para>

	<para>
	A tile is marked by the placement of the cards that make it up.  Each
	card in a tile overlaps the card before it.  Tiles are formed from
	left to right (the second card in the tile is placed over the right
	side of the first, and so on).  All cards' values should be visible.
	This placement is demonstrated in the diagram under "Tile" in the
	glossary.
	</para>

	<para>
	When a tile is broken up, its cards are separated (no longer tiled).
	No immediate effects of those cards occur, but their continuous effects
	come into play, and any triggered effects they may have are subject
	to activation should the trigger conditions be set up (see section
	2.3 for information about immediate, continuous, and triggered
	effects).
	</para>
    </section>

    <section id="protected">
    <title>Protected Cards</title>
	<para>
	Certain cards are called "protected cards."  Such cards will specify
	their status as such.  A protected card cannot be affected by any card
	that doesn't specifically state that it affects protected cards.
	</para>
    </section>

    <section id="noeffect">
    <title>No-effect Cards</title>
	<para>
	If a card is brought into play no-effect, its immediate effects do
	not occur.  While a card is no-effect, any continuous or triggered
	effects it may have are ignored.  A card that is no-effect cannot
	be affected by any special card rule of another card unless the
	special card rule specifically says that it applies to no-effect
	cards.
	</para>

	<para>
	A card is marked as no-effect by placing it sideways on your table.
	If a no-effect card is replayed, it is no longer no-effect.

    <title>Immediate Effects</title>
	<para>
	Any effect that doesn't specify that it is one of the other types of
	effects is an immediate effect.  Such an effect is resolved as soon as
	the card that causes it is played.  If the effect cannot be resolved
	immediately (e.g., a 2&spades; is played and none of your opponents
	have cards on their tables) it is lost completely; it cannot be

	were an immediate effect of a card that was just played.  The effect
	will specify when you may use it.  The card must be <emphasis>in
	play</emphasis> for you to use its effect; you cannot discard the
	card from your cards-to-be-played or your viewing hand in order to

    <title>Using Effects</title>
	<para>
	Some cards have effects on other cards (e.g., the 2&spades;).  Unless
	otherwise specified, effects of this type do not effect protected or
	no-effect cards.  Other cards have effects on a player's 5-card poker
	hand.  Unless otherwise specified, effects of this type do effect
	protected and no-effect cards.  If a card has an effect on all cards
	or any group of cards defined in a way other than those listed above,
	then it will specify whether it affects protected and/or no-effect
	cards.

<title>Playing a Joker, 1 of Red, 1 of a Suit</title>
    <para>
    The 1 is something of an anomaly.  An ace is not a 1, it is an A.
    A Joker is a 1 of Black.
    A 1 of Red is created when any red card's numeric value is changed down
    from 2 or up from A by a five.  A card who's numeric value is made 1 in
    this way does not count as a 1 of any suit; it is either a 1 of red (if
    it was originally a red card) or a 1 of black (if it was originally a
    black card).  A 1 of a suit is created when a joker is played as the
    last card of a double-five card set (see the rules for the double-five
    card set).

	    &trig-start;A card is being forced onto your table&trig-end;
	    You may discard both the 6 and the 10&diamonds;.  If you do so,
	    the card is not played on your table.  You instead force it onto
	    the table of the player who was forcing it onto your table.  If
	    the card was coming to you via a Q or Q-in-effect, that Q is also
	    returned to the table of the person trying to pass it to you.  If
	    it was a Q-in-effect, the player plays the card that was used as
	    a Q-in-effect after playing the card he tried to pass with it.

	    If a K &clubs; is to be played upon you and you want to reflect it,
	    you must use 2 full reflector pairs to do so (two 10&diamonds; and
	    two 6s).
