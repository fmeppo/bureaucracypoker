<title>Special Rulings</title>
    <para>
    This is the definition of special game situations or card combinations.
    It should be followed when applicable.  Most of these rulings cover either
    really wierd situations that need special attention or quick-fixes in the
    game due to contradictions in other rules.  Old rulings that fall under
    that latter heading may be removed as general game mechanics are updated,
    and new rulings may be brought into existence as the game evolves.
    A general measure of how consistent the rules are can be found as an
    inverse proportion to the length of this chapter.  At some times, there
    may be no rules in this chapter.  When this is the case, it's a good
    thing.

    <para>
    For all rulings in this chapter, Player B is sitting next to Player A
    such that he is the next in the direction of play, Player C is next to
    Player B, etc.  Player 1, Player 2, etc. are totally arbitrary players
    and may be sitting in any order.

<title>Deadlock</title>

    <para>
    If the turn passes all the way around the table with no cards being
    played (e.e., all players have the maximum number of cards on their
    tables, two players are tied for the highest 5-card poker hand, and
    each player in turn chooses to keep his hand), then all players must
    immediately scrap their hands and play progresses as normal.

<section id="buffers">
<title>Buffers</title>

    <para>
    During any turn, any player may form a buffer to the pot or to the discard.
    Placing a card in the buffer counts as playing it on the pile associated
    with the buffer.  No player may have more than one buffer to each pile.
    Buffers cannot be formed to any pile other than the pot or the discard.
    </para>

    <para>
    A player must flush his buffer (move its contents to the associated pile)
    if:
